# 👋 Hi, I'm Choisaint  
### Mechatronics Engineering Student | Embedded Systems Developer | Robotics & Rapid Prototyping

I'm a mechatronics engineering student passionate about building real, functional systems — from rovers and drones to fully automated machines using embedded controllers, electronics, and mechanical design.

I focus on hands-on engineering, rapid prototyping, and applied robotics. I also founded **Synkro**, an engineering initiative that connects students from multiple universities to develop open, high-impact robotics and automation projects.
